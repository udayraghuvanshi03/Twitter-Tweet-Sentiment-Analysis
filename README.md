# Twitter-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets from Twitter. The repository contains various scripts and notebooks for preprocessing data, and implementing and evaluating machine learning models.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a common text classification task where the goal is to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we analyze the sentiment of tweets, categorizing them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Usage
- Preprocess the data using the preprocessing.ipynb notebook.
- Train the sentiment analysis models using logistic_reg.ipynb and naive_bayes.ipynb. This can also be used to compare performance.
- Utilize the utils.py script for additional utilities and helper functions.
